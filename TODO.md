This document contains my thoughts on where I'd like to take this script in the future, mostly in no particular order.

## Almost certain to happen

* filtering — JS needs to be able to parse / reorder tattoo blocks
* sort on title — Currently sorts on sigil, which makes it look unsorted.  (May be tricky?  Maps seem to have limited sorting support.)
* random tattoo — Should be trivial in JS.

## Might happen

* other sort orders — Restore to by-sigil sort?  Is there any value to other sorts?
* custom section ordering — Would need stored in preferences, presumably using ZLib.
* remembering section collapse state — Ditto preferences.
* hiding individual tattoos — Sounds cool, but might be a hassle.  Work on other stuff first.

## Won't happen

* unearned tattoo tracking — Use [Cheesecookie's Snapshot Maker](http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showthread.php?t=218735) instead.
