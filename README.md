## About

This script replaces the default tatto selection page with something a little more full-featured.

* single-click tattoo selection
* displays tattoo source (e.g. outfit, item, ascension, …)
* sources linked to relevant pages on TheKolWiki
* filter based on source or "sigil" name (e.g. "Crimbo tattoo kit" or "c18tat")
* random tattoo selection

## Installation

To install, open KoLmafia's gCLI and enter:

    svn checkout https://github.com/benblank/kolmafia-tattoo-picker/branches/Release

## Troubleshooting

### I have an "Unknown" tattoo

Whoops!  That means my database is out of date.  Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/benblank/kolmafia-tattoo-picker/issues) requesting that I add your Unknown tattoos, and include how you got them (if you remember).

### I have a "Mystery" tattoo

These are tattoos which I know exist, but have no other information about.  Currently, there's only opne of these — crimborgtat — and if you have information about how it was obtained, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/benblank/kolmafia-tattoo-picker/issues)!
