## About

This script replaces the default tatto selection page with something a little more full-featured.

* single-click tattoo selection
* displays tattoo source (e.g. outfit, item, ascension, â€¦)
* sources linked to relevant pages on TheKolWiki
* filter based on source or "sigil" name (e.g. "Crimbo tattoo kit" or "c18tat")
* random tattoo selection
